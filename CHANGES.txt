Changelog

  [davisagli]

  [davisagli]

1.0 (2009-11-11)
----------------

* No longer artificially restrict to z3c.form <2.0, as that is a deployment

  [davisagli]

* Only depend on plone.app.jquerytools, not Products.pipbox.

  avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when the system default encoding is ASCII.
  [davisagli]

* Check the persistent template setting in the formgen_tool when determining
  whether to update the mailer templates, rather than the default
  default from PFG's config.py
  [davisagli]

* Fixed issue with marshalling field size.
  [davisagli]

* Fixed action adapter processing on the final send step when a CAPTCHA field
  is in use.
