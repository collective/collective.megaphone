  [davisagli]

1.0 (2009-11-11)
----------------

* No longer artificially restrict to z3c.form <2.0, as that is a deployment

  additional fake eggs to avoid pulling in new zope.* packages.
  [davisagli]

* Only depend on plone.app.jquerytools, not Products.pipbox.

  avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when the system default encoding is ASCII.
  [davisagli]

* Check the persistent template setting in the formgen_tool when determining
  whether to update the mailer templates, rather than the default
  default from PFG's config.py
  [davisagli]
