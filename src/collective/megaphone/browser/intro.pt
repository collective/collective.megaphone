<p>The following pages allow you to configure an action letter. This wizard will help you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>set up the <strong>information you'd like to collect from each letter-writer</strong></li>
    <li>specify the <strong>possible recipients</strong> for your letter</li>
    <li><strong>format the emails</strong> that get sent</li>
    <li>set up a <strong>thank you email</strong> that gets sent to each of your letter-writers</li>
    <li>after you complete the form, you'll see a list of links allowing you to see
        what you've created as well as perform any advanced set up that's needed</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Please note</strong> that until you've hit the "Finish" button at the end of the wizard, nothing will be saved to your site!
    However, you may navigate backwards and forwards through the wizard before you're done.
