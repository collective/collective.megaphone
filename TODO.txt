Megaphone itself is now compatible with Plone 4.  However we need Plone
4.0a5, a Plone 4-compatible release of PloneFormGen, and a Plone
4-compatible release of collective.jqueryui before it's usable.

FTI:
- unique icon for type
- unique add permission for type

misc:
- what to do about fieldsets?

comments/notes from Drew:
- on fields screen, tried to click Continue without clicking Apply changes first ... confusing
