FTI:
- unique icon for type
- unique add permission for type

misc:
- what to do about fieldsets?

comments/notes from Drew:
- 'default text' instead of 'default value'
- actually supply a default value for the letter body, something like "I'd like to express my support for XXX"
- on fields screen, tried to click Continue without clicking Apply changes first ... confusing
